# Android-Kiosk-Mode
💤 Android Kiosk App to enforce Alarm on Sleep As Android Production App

⚠️ I'm uploading this project to the public for the sake of portfolio only!

🆘 The purpose of this is a personal project that I made for myself in year ~2017 that helped me to overcome snoozing morning alarms from the App: Sleep as Android (urbandroid) (a popular alarm app on Google Play Store).

```
When using the Kiosk mode of this App, you can no longer snooze or close or uninstall the alarm up until you scan the QR code.
One time it happened to be on a trip and I didn't had the QR code with me, an awkward moment that I had to keep the phone for at least 4 hours to ring the alarm until the battery of my Android phone went off. 😄

⚒️ The project uses:
```
- Activate Device Admin
- Open Notification Access
- Open Accessibility Access
- Start heads up display
- Enable optimisation for Accessibility
```
